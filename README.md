# Pentacle
Pentacle is an advanced API mod for Brutal Orchestra.

# Features
Currently Pentacle contains the following features:
* "Advanced" versions of `AbilitySO`, `AdvancedCharacterSO` and `AdvancedEnemySO` providing extended functionality.
* A "hidden passive effects" system, allowing modders to add hidden passive abilities to their enemies and characters.
* Custom tools for building in-game content such as abilities, characters, enemies, stored values and more.
* Custom trigger calls.
* Tools for adding custom final bosses to Fogs' final boss selection.
* The "trigger effect" system that almost completely generalizes passive and item creation, pretty much removing the need for custom passive/item classes.
* An array of other miscellaneous tools.

Note: Pentacle is not a replacement for BrutalAPI. Pentacle was designed to be usable alongside BrutalAPI.
